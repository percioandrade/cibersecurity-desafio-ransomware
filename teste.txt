I guess now it's time for me to give up
I feel it's time
Got a picture of you beside me
Got your lipstick mark still on your coffee cup
Oh, yeah

Got a fist of pure emotion
Got a head of shattered dreams
Gotta leave it
Gotta leave it all behind now

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(I want you back)
(I want you back)
(I want you back for good)

Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(I want you back)
(I want you back)
(I want you back for good) I want you back for good

Unaware, but underlined
I figured out the story (no, no)
It wasn't good (no, no)
But in the corner of my mind (corner of my mind)
I celebrated glory
But that was not to be

In the twist of separation
You excelled at being free
Can't you find (can't you find)
A little room inside for me?

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(I want you back)
(I want you back)
(I want you back for good) see, I want you back for good

Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(I want you back)
(I want you back)
(I want you back for good) I want you back for good

And we'll be together, this time is forever
(Forever now)
We'll be fighting and forever we will be
So complete in our love
We will never be uncovered again

Whatever I said, whatever I did
I didn't mean it
I just want you back for good
(I want you back)
(I want you back)
(I want you back for good)

Whenever I'm wrong
Just tell me the song and I'll sing it
You'll be right and understood
(I want you back)
(I want you back)
(I want you back for good) see, I want you back for good

(Whatever I said) whenever I'm wrong, I'll tell you
(Whatever I did, I didn't mean it)
(I just want you back for good)
(I want you back)
(I want you back) I want you back
(I want you back for good) I want you back for good

(Whenever I'm wrong) whenever I'm wrong, I'll tell you
(Just tell me the song and I'll sing it)
(You'll be right and understood)

(I want you back)
(I want you back)
(I want you back for good) see, I want you back for good
Oh, yeah

I guess now it's time
That you came back for good
